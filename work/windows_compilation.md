Windows compilation tutorial WIP
================================

My notes about trying to compile Solarus dev branch (1.6) on Windows 10.
Using QtCreator and MinGW32.

First build
-----------

Setup a build environment:

- Install QtCreator
  - open-source version
  - Qt 5.10.0
  - With MinGW 5.3.0 32 bit (check both toolchain + Qt components)
  - With QtWebEngine
- Install Git
  - From git-scm.com
- Install CMake
  - Windows installer from cmake officiel website

Setup Solarus build:

- Clone the repositories
  - Optionally: upload public key
- Install all dependencies

Build Solarus
